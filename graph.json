The objective of this course is to expose students to the broad field of animal behavior.  The course will include the historical underpinnings of the field as well as the contemporary theories for a wide variety of behaviors.  Behavioral ecology and the evolution of animal behaviors as adaptations will be intertwined throughout the course, as well potential applications of knowledge about animal behavior. Students will be able to analyze existing evidence and investigate modern practices in order to evaluate existing theories and consider potential future directions of animal behavior.  Using current scientific literature, as well as case-studies, students will be able to come up with their own hypotheses and determine how different hypotheses related to animal behavior can be tested experimentally.  Students will also gain hands-on experience in trying out some of the fundamental techniques."

We will use a comparative approach to examine the physiology of animals including major physiological systems, with an emphasis on vertebrates. Topics to be covered include metabolic, temperature, osmotic and ionic regulation; respiration and circulatory transport, digestive, muscle, nervous, and locomotor systems; endocrine regulation and biological rhythms. We will further examine how physiological systems are integrated and thus allow animals to respond, physiologically, in different environment."

The goal of this course is to understand material selection, important properties of materials for use in the body, and failure modes of applied biomaterials. The course will cover the structure and properties of materials used as biomaterials including metals, ceramics, synthetic polymers, and biopolymers. The structure of these materials will be explored to understand how it defines the behavior of a material. The bulk behavior of materials will be reviewed, including the generalized Hooke's Law, and new concepts will be introduced (including thermal strain, surface properties, and viscoelasticity). Students will be presented with problems of property characterization, failure analysis and performance testing. Students will work in teams to analyze a marketed implant or device using biomaterial(s) using the tool and concepts learned in the course."

Optimization techniques provide the core foundation for the processing of the data and learning from it. This course covers the basic analytical and algorithmic optimization tools that lay the foundation for the data analytics and deep learning systems. Specific topics include single-objective convex optimization (duality, optimality conditions, algorithms), gradients-based methods, and the fundamentals of multi-objective optimization and game theory. The theoretical foundation and the fundamental algorithms are applied to real-world scenarios that utilize supervised learning models, including nonlinear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep neural networks."

With the explosion of \u201cBig Data\u201d problems, statistical learning has become a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as in marketing, finance, and business. Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data. Specifically, supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model to predict or estimate an output or pattern based on one or more inputs. For unsupervised learning there are inputs, but no supervising output, and here the goal is to learn relationships and structure from the data. This course provides a systematic introduction to statistical machine learning and pattern recognition using fundamental performance criteria as guiding principles and studies how these principles affect real-world performance. Topics covered include practical techniques as linear and kernel models for classification and regression, unsupervised probabilistic modeling, probabilistic graphical models, and approximate inference, but also theoretical underpinnings as VC dimension and sample complexity."

Restriction: This course is intended for engineering majors. This is a course for junior level undergraduates in any engineering discipline focusing on the use of data science techniques to solve problems in engineering. We will first discuss the Python programming language and how it can be used to access, manipulate, explore, and visualize scientific datasets. We will discuss statistics and probability as it applies to engineering problems such as safety factors and probability of part failure; this includes conditional probability, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian inference. We will then discuss more advanced statistical models (\u201cmachine learning\u201d), including linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and clustering. Possible applications of these methods will be demonstrated in such disciplines and topics as (but not limited to): chemical, mechanical and electrical engineering (optimization and controls), materials engineering (structure and property databases), biomedical engineering (medical diagnosis and medical imaging) and electrical and computer engineering (signal processing, target tracking, robotic navigation). Students will gain hands-on experience in implementing and utilizing these various methods through computational laboratory assignments and reports and a semester-long engineering design project."

The course begins with an overview of web technologies. Students learn to plan websites, which includes determining the business and end-user requirements for the site. Design includes learning to develop \"mockups\" of how the site will look and how people will use it. The major tools for building websites will be industry standard HTML and XHTML to describe webpage content, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for flexibly formatting the content. Using XHTML and CSS makes it relatively simple to change formats across the entire site, as well as \"future-proofs\" a website, allowing it to be viewed on every major web browser (such as Firefox or Chrome) and easily adapt to changes in future browser technology. The course features substantial hands-on projects comprising websites of several interlinked pages and images, enabling students to thoroughly learn the course's important concepts and skills."

Such programming is known as client-side scripting. These interactive websites utilize forms to gather user inputs, and vary both the content and display of the webpages based on the current user tasks and preferences. This includes designing and dynamically changing tabs and menus, as well as expanding and contracting sections of pages. Students will develop a thorough understanding of website usability (designing effective sites that people like, security and user privacy, browser capability (ensuring websites work on every major web browser), and the tools and skills that web developers use to add interactive features to websites. These skills include Javascript (for programming interactive features), the Document Object Model or DOM (specifying the internal structure of web pages), JQuery (to access information utilizing this internal structure, create animations and generally streamline Javascript), browser variables (providing information about the browser characteristics), HTML input forms, form validation (ensuring correctness of user input), securing user input (to ensure user privacy), cookies (tracking user information), basic communication with the web server (which processes the information users input into forms), and AJAX ( which integrates many of these technologies).

Businesses use databases extensively for analysis and decision-making because they provide efficient, large-scale information storage and rapid retrieval. Databases support the \"back end functionality\" of most large web systems. This course gives students extensive, pragmatic experience in designing, building, querying, updating, maintaining and managing relational databases, using the Structured Query Language (SQL). Proper database design principles are emphasized throughout the course, beginning with high level descriptions of relational databases using data modeling tools (such as entity-relationship or ER diagrams)and progressing to relational database design principles based on higher order normalizations. We will examine some poorly designed databases and show how these can be transformed into well designed databases. SQL will be extensively covered, and students will design and implement sophisticated SQL queries invoking self-joins, outer joins, correlated subqueries and related concepts. Students will explore and utilize design methodologies for input data validation and maintaining database integrity, and study issues of database privacy and security. Advanced topics to be discussed include the role of the Database Administrator (DBA), database life cycle activities, database denormalization, read-only databases and data warehouses. Hands-on experience will be gained by working with actual databases using industry-standard database management systems such as Oracle.

We cover a wide spectrum of topics ranging from fundamental statistics to database, data warehouse, data visualization, and data mining, with a special focus on predictive analysis. Being an introductory course, our approach is \u201cshallow and wide\u201d, emphasizing on giving students a complete view of the data analytics profession, covering as many different sub-areas as time allows while not diving too deep into any one specific domain. The goal is to serve as a \u201cguided tour\u201d for students to gain knowledge about the different sub-areas of data analytics and understanding of which area is a best fit for their personal developments. More in-depth materials and discussion for each sub-area will be provided upon students\u2019 requests.

These are not the only elements of theatre that do this, but this course is an opportunity to focus on these specialties often overlooked and uses the foundation and making of PPP to learn digital, physical, interpersonal, and playful skills needed to tell stories in unexpected ways. The history, craft, and techniques of PPP are vast, and students will gain an exposure to this knowledge while engaging in class workshops, research, and continuous prototyping. Along with their skills in text analysis and collaboration, students will be challenged to use just these three elements to enhance a story and create cohesive, transformative, theatrical moments."

We'll dive deep into the psychology of storytelling, exploring why we're drawn to narratives and how they can influence our lives. From ancient myths to modern-day memes, we'll examine how stories are woven into the fabric of our culture. We'll also explore the power of storytelling to inspire, challenge, and connect us. This course will use readings, discussions, hands-on projects, and both theoretical and practical explorations to uncover the hidden stories that shape our lives and give the student the agency and tools to question those premises and recreate their own narratives."
