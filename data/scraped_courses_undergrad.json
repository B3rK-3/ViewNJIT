They explore an overarching programming paradigm that integrates two distinct architectural models to tackle complex challenges, such as training generative or agentic AI models using convolution neural networks and performing inference with latent search. Through the Message Passing Interface (MPI), students learn to program clusters of Linux computers, embodying the Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) architectural model. Simultaneously, they delve into Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) to program thousands of GPU cores, following the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architectural model. By employing the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) programming paradigm, students combine MPI and CUDA to address large-scale problems on CUDA-capable Linux clusters effectively.\nThe topics on MPI entail mainly communication mechanisms between many computers, which are point to point, collective, and one-sided. The topics on CUDA entail primarily methodologies to solve essential computing problems, including convolution, histogram, reduction, prefix sum (scan), merge, radix sorting, graph traversal, and convolution neural networks. The course is project-oriented and as such at the end of semester, students will be able to solve a difficult problem using a cluster of CUDA-capable computers."

Businesses use databases extensively for analysis and decision-making because they provide efficient, large-scale information storage and rapid retrieval. Databases support the \"back end functionality\" of most large web systems. This course gives students extensive, pragmatic experience in designing, building, querying, updating, maintaining and managing relational databases, using the Structured Query Language (SQL). Proper database design principles are emphasized throughout the course, beginning with high level descriptions of relational databases using data modeling tools (such as entity-relationship or ER diagrams)and progressing to relational database design principles based on higher order normalizations. We will examine some poorly designed databases and show how these can be transformed into well designed databases. SQL will be extensively covered, and students will design and implement sophisticated SQL queries invoking self-joins, outer joins, correlated subqueries and related concepts. Students will explore and utilize design methodologies for input data validation and maintaining database integrity, and study issues of database privacy and security. Advanced topics to be discussed include the role of the Database Administrator (DBA), database life cycle activities, database denormalization, read-only databases and data warehouses. Hands-on experience will be gained by working with actual databases using industry-standard database management systems such as Oracle.

In addition, we will examine how gender-specific selection influences offspring care and attachment, aggression and friendship. Throughout the course, we will evaluate which principals can and cannot be extrapolated to human behavior as well as how we as humans project our ideas of gender onto our study of the natural world. We will critically discuss contemporary articles concerning gender in the popular media."

The prerequisite is a college ability to communicate competently in the English language including the ability to research and prepare essay compositions and to articulate the major points in a presentation format. The introduction to Environmental Law will cover the regulatory system developed over time that has forged a complex system of environmental rules influencing industrial and other private and public actions that impact the environment. The course will review these rules from the vantage point of the practicing technical environmental engineer and scientist. Students will become familiar with the background and derivation of these laws as well as the major operational features such as environmental permits and enforcement. Several major environmental cases will be analyzed that give definition to the key features of these laws. Each class module will direct itself to the practical application of these laws."

Instead of covering different types of materials separately, this course will use the principles common to engineering of all important materials as an underlying theme. These are atomic/molecular structure, nanoscale, morphology, principles of phase transformation, structure development during processing, and property dependence on structure. All these topics will be introduced through the paradigm of comparing metals, ceramics and polymers. Besides single component systems, advanced materials such as multiphase and/or multicomponent systems (e.g. composites and gels) and nanomaterials will be discussed based on these principles. An integral part of this course will be the criteria for selection of materials for specific end-use conditions and customer specifications, which can incorporate various engineering standards and multiple constraints such as public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors."

Students will do this by learning about Smart Contract and the most important use cases in DeFi (decentralized finance), Healthcare, Supply Chain Management, Agribusiness, etc. Students will analyze how smart contracts work, how they're used today, how to reason about their capabilities, and what ongoing technical challenges they pose. In the course project, students will come up with their own application and outline the challenges that might exist in BCT adoption."
