Everything has become a cloud - even the formerly-rigid wireless proprietary nodes, known as base stations, are broken up to independently developed network micro-services running on cloud-native runtimes supported by commodity compute and storage. Networking has become a software business and complete network disaggregation is the end game. In this new world, network operators are increasingly becoming content providers and they abandon R&D-heavy network disaggregation initiatives run by the Linux Foundation and increasingly trust public cloud providers to run their networks and take full advantage of the public cloud completely abstracted set of APIs to build applications faster than they could ever do before.\nDrawing from these trends, the course aims on one hand to provide a foundation of the so called multi-cloud network environment and on the other, to provide the student with the tools and knowledge required to understand how these multi-cloud networks are operated / managed via a set of data-driven distributed applications, the Cognitive Network Apps, that bring Machine Learning / AI and big network data analytics together. We treat the most important networking architectures and technologies that empower today\u2019s cloud provider networks at the core / edge such as CDN and 5G and learn how self-healing, self-optimization and self-configuration applications provide the reliability, resiliency and performance metrics needed by cloud applications such as Netflix, Zoom and many others."

They do this by understanding potential user's practice, preferences and mental models. As a result, knowledge of a basic set of qualitative customer discovery methods is essential for both the lean startup entrepreneur and those engaged in interaction design innovation. This course teaches these methods through hands-on team projects. Students will design and run interview and diary studies, thinking out-loud protocols and focus groups, and analyze and report on findings. Students will explore over the course of the semester a problem domain and gain understanding of customer needs that will serve as a foundation for high-tech, innovative product design."

However, sustainable chemistry is rarely taught to chemists in any depth, if at all. Education in chemical science and engineering must change rapidly to deal with unsustainability. This course emphasizes the concept of sustainable risks, i.e., that each chemical reaction and conversion process has risks associated with the production, and the role of chemists and engineers is to minimize this risk and reduce the impact on human health and the environment."

This class will combine theoretical concepts (lectures) with laboratory and field studies to integrate the basic principles of environmental engineering, chemistry and microbiology to solve practical problems of assessment and treatment of contaminated sites. In the lectures, the students will be introduced to environmental regulations, the theoretical concepts for environmental sampling design, the procedures for analytical techniques, and traditional and cutting-edge remediation approaches. These lectures will be supplemented with peer-reviewed articles, technical reports, and operational methods. The field studies will consist in sampling collection methods, where the students will participate in a one-day sampling trip to a contaminated site to collect water, sediments, and plants samples. The students will then process the samples in the laboratory for further analysis for the contaminants of interest. Using this information, the students will prepare a Feasibility Study/Remedial Investigation (FS/RI) for their targeted site where they will evaluate three to five remediation strategies and will propose one final remediation design. The final RI/RD will be presented to the whole class in a mock Community Advisory Group (CAG) session."

Some examples of ECs include PFAS, 1,4-dioxane, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and many others, which are found in various water sources and food chains. Unfortunately, traditional water and wastewater treatment processes do not effectively remove them, and thus advanced and novel technologies have been developed over recent decades to address these contaminants. This course will introduce students to the theoretical concepts and design of such novel systems for treating ECs. These lectures will be supplemented with peer-reviewed articles, technical reports, and case studies.

We will first discuss the Python programming language and how it can be used to manipulate, clean, explore, and visualize scientific datasets using the pandas package. We will the cover statistics and probability as it applies to engineering problems; this includes conditional probability, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian inference. Basic supervised machine learning models will be introduced, including linear and logistic regression, decision trees and random forest, and support vector machines. Students will then learn different analytical techniques and how to combine all of these skills to solve engineering problems involving large amounts of data and make predictions. Finally, we will cover how to access data and create your own datasets; topics include databases (including relational databases such as SQL) and basic data mining and web scraping. Applications of these methods will be demonstrated in chemical engineering (e.g., optimization and controls, sensor analysis), materials engineering (e.g., structural databases and property selection), and pharmaceutical engineering (e.g., drug selection). Students will gain hands-on experience in implementing and utilizing these various methods through computational laboratory assignments and reports and a semester-long engineering design project."

The cleaning, sterilization and scaling/capping required for each dosage form is discussed, as well as freeze-drying, tableting capsule filling, and form/fill/seal, and proper labeling of final drug forms."
